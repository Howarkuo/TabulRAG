"The USP32–NF27 describes two types of sodium starch glycolate, Type A and Type B, and states that sodium starch glycolate is the sodium salt of a carboxymethyl ether of starch or of a crosslinked carboxymethyl ether of starch.","Sodium starch glycolate is widely used in oral pharmaceuticals as a disintegrant in capsule(1–6) and tablet formulations.(7–10) It is commonly used in tablets prepared by either direct-compression(11–13) or wet-granulation processes.(14–16) The usual concentration employed in a formulation is between 2% and 8%, with the optimum concentration about 4%, although in many cases 2% is sufficient. Disintegration occurs by rapid uptake of water followed by rapid and enormous swelling.(17–20)"
"The PhEur 6.0 describes three types of material: Type A and Type B are described as the sodium salt of a crosslinked partly carboxymethylated potato starch. Type C is described as the sodium salt of a partly O-carboxymethylated starch, crosslinked by physical dehydration. Types A, B, and C are differentiated by their pH, sodium, and sodium chloride content.","Although the effectiveness of many disintegrants is affected by the presence of hydrophobic excipients such as lubricants, the disintegrant efficiency of sodium starch glycolate is unimpaired. Increasing the tablet compression pressure also appears to have no effect on disintegration time.(10–12) Sodium starch glycolate has also been investigated for use as a suspending vehicle.(21)"
