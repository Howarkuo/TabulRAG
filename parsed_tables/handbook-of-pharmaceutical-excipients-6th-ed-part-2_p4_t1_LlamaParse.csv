**Stability and Storage Conditions**,Sodium carbonate converts to the monohydrate form when in contact with water and produces heat. It begins to lose carbon dioxide at temperatures above 400°C(7) and decomposes before boiling. Store in airtight containers.
**Incompatibilities**,"Sodium carbonate decomposes when in contact with acids in the presence of water to produce carbon dioxide and effervescence. It may react violently with aluminum, phosphorous pentoxide, sulfuric acid, fluorine, and lithium."
**Method of Manufacture**,"Sodium carbonate is produced by the ammonia-soda process, also known as the Solvay process.(7) Comments Listed in PhEur 6.0 and JP XV. Used in alkaline baths.(4)"
Empirical formula,Na₂CO₃·H₂O
Molecular weight,124.0
CAS number,[5968-11-6]
Description,Colorless or white crystals or granules.
Solubility,"Soluble in 3 parts water, 1.8 parts boiling water, or 7 parts glycerin. Practically insoluble in ethanol (95%). Dries out in warm dry air or above 50°C, and converts to anhydrous form above 100°C."
Comments,Listed in PhEur 6.0 and USP32–NF27. Commonly used in antacid preparations and as a reagent.(4)
**Safety**,"Sodium carbonate is used in injectable, oral, and rectal pharmaceutical formulations. The pure form of sodium carbonate is mildly toxic by ingestion, moderately toxic by inhalation and SC routes, and very toxic by the IP route. It is irritating to the skin and eyes. Dust and vapors of sodium carbonate may irritate mucous membranes, causing coughing and shortness of breath. It also has experimental reproductive effects. Sodium carbonate can migrate to food from packaging materials. When used as an excipient or antacid, sodium carbonate is generally regarded as a nontoxic and nonirritating material."
"LD₅₀ (mouse, IP)",0.12 g/kg(8)
"LD₅₀ (mouse, SC)",2.21 g/kg
"LD₅₀ (rat, oral)",4.09 g/kg
**Handling Precautions**,Observe normal precautions appropriate to the circumstances and quantity of the material handled. When heated to decomposition it emits toxic fumes of sodium oxide. Eye protection and gloves are recommended. Respiratory protection is also recommended if inhalable dust is present.
**Regulatory Status**,"GRAS listed. Accepted for use as a food additive in Europe. Included in the FDA Inactive Ingredients Database (injections; ophthalmic solution; oral capsules and tablets; rectal suspensions). Included in the Canadian List of Acceptable Non-medicinal Ingredients. Included in parenteral (powder for solution for injection) and nonparenteral medicines (oral effervescent tablets, soluble tablets, granules, lozenges, chewing gums) licensed in the UK. USP32–NF27 allows either the anhydrous or the monohydrate form."
**Related Substances**,Sodium bicarbonate; sodium carbonate decahydrate; sodium carbonate monohydrate.
