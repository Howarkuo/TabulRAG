Section,Title,Content
13,Method of Manufacture,Sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate is manufactured from sodium dithionate and formaldehyde in water.
14,Safety,"The toxicological properties of sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate have not been fully investigated. However, it is used in the formulation of injection products at a level to 0.1% w/v in the final preparation administered to the patient. Sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate is moderately toxic by ingestion, and when heated to decomposition it emits toxic fumes of sulfur dioxide and sodium oxide.(1)"
18,Comments,"Sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate has been investigated as an antidote to mercury poisoning, but is considered less effective than dimercaprol (British anti-lewisite (BAL)) and other treatments.(3,4) It is also used as an industrial bleach. It is used in chemical synthesis as a nucleophilic agent in the preparation of sulfones. The empirical formula and molecular weight are also given as CH₄O₃SNa and 119.1, respectively.(1) The EINECS number for sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate is 205-739-4. The PubChem Compound ID for sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate is 23725019."
16,Regulatory Status,"Included in the FDA Inactive Ingredients Database (parenteral products up to 0.1% via the IM, IV, and SC routes). Included in the Canadian List of Acceptable Non-medicinal Ingredients."
17,Related Substances,Zinc formaldehyde sulfoxylate.
