Description,"Sodium starch glycolate is a white or almost white free-flowing very hygroscopic powder. The PhEur 6.0 states that when examined under a microscope it is seen to consist of: granules, irregularly shaped, ovoid or pear-shaped, 30–100 mm in size, or rounded, 10–35 mm in size; compound granules consisting of 2–4 components occur occasionally; the granules have an eccentric hilum and clearly visible concentric striations. Between crossed nicol prisms, the granules show a distinct black cross intersecting at the hilum; small crystals are visible at the surface of the granules. The granules show considerable swelling in contact with water."
