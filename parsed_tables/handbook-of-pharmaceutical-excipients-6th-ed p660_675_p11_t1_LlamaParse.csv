No.,Nonproprietary Names,SEM 1: Excipient: sodium thiosulfate; magnification: 100  ; voltage: 10 kV.
4,Empirical Formula and Molecular Weight,1000 μm
7,Applications in Pharmaceutical Formulation or Technology,"Sodium thiosulfate is used as an antioxidant in pharmaceuticals (ophthalmic, intravenous, and oral preparations). It has also been used for its antifungal properties(1) and as a reagent in analytical chemistry."
8,Description,"Sodium thiosulfate occurs as odorless and colorless crystals, a crystalline powder or granules. It is efflorescent in dry air and deliquescent in moist air."
11,Stability and Storage Conditions,"Sodium thiosulfate decomposes on heating. The bulk powder should be stored in a cool place, and the container should be kept tightly closed in a dry and well-ventilated place. It should not be stored near acids."
12,Incompatibilities,"Sodium thiosulfate is incompatible with iodine, with acids, and with lead, mercury, and silver salts. It may reduce the activity of some preservatives, including bronopol, phenylmercuric salts, and thimerosal.(1)"
9,Pharmacopeial Specifications,See Table I.
10,Typical Properties,Acidity/alkalinity      Aqueous solution practically neutral at pH 6.5–8.0 (pentahydrate).
14,Safety,"Sodium thiosulfate is used in ophthalmic, intravenous, and oral pharmaceutical preparations. Apart from osmotic disturbances, sodium thiosulfate is relatively nontoxic. It is moderately toxic by"
