Section,Title,Details
11,Stability and Storage Conditions,"Sodium borate anhydrous. Sodium borate should be stored in a well-closed container in a cool, dry place. See also Section 18."
13,Method of Manufacture,"Sodium borate can be prepared from minerals such as borosodium calcite, pandermite, or tinkal; these are natural sodium or calcium borates. Treatment of the mineral with sodium carbonate and sodium hydrogencarbonate yields the sodium borate decahydrate. In the USA, brine from salt lakes is also an important source of sodium borate.(3)"
14,Safety,"Sodium borate has weak bacteriostatic and astringent properties. Historically, sodium borate has been used as a disinfectant in skin lotions and eye-, nose-, and mouthwashes. However, boric acid is easily absorbed via mucous membranes and damaged skin, and severe toxicity has been observed, especially in babies and children.(4) Consequently, the use of sodium borate as a disinfectant is now considered somewhat obsolete and careful use is recommended. The toxic effects of sodium borate include vomiting, diarrhea, erythema, CNS depression, and kidney damage. The lethal oral intake is approximately 20 g in adults and 5 g in children.(5)"
15,Handling Precautions,Observe normal precautions appropriate to the circumstances and the quantity of material handled; do not combine with acids.
16,Regulatory Status,"Accepted for use as a food additive in Europe. Included in the FDA Inactive Ingredients Database (otic preparations; ophthalmic solutions and suspensions). Included in nonparenteral medicines licensed in the UK, Italy, France, Germany, and Japan. Included in the Canadian List of Acceptable Non-medicinal Ingredients."
